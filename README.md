# What it is

Halcyon is an [XMPP](https://xmpp.org) client library written in a [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) programming
language. It provides implementation of core of the XMPP standard and processing XML. Additionally it provides support
for many popular extensions (XEP's).

Library using [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/multiplatform.html) feature to provide XMPP
library for as many platforms as possible. Currently we are focused on

* JVM
* JavaScript
* Android

In the future we want to provide native binary version. 

This repository contains source files of the library.

# Features
Halcyon implements support for [RFC 6120: Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Core](https://xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc6120.html) and [RFC 6121: Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Instant Messaging and Presence](https://xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc6121.html).

Halcyon is under active development, so list of features is changing very often.
